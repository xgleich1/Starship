The goal of this project is to create software to control
SpaceX's starship, recreated in Kerbal Space Program.

Kerbal Space Program is built with Unity and aims to be
close to reality physics-wise. On top of this it can be
modded using the C# language.

It's perfect to explode lot's of starships while learning
the fundamentals of building software for rockets! 

Finally a few important points in general:

* I have no idea how to program software for rockets, which 
  means lot's to learn. Any feedback is highly appreciated!
  
* I am an android developer by trade and have no idea
  how C# works. Would love lot's of feedback to improve!
  
---------- The goal was achieved after 1,5 years ----------

Starship was controlled to follow a flight inspired by SN10's.
