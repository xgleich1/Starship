Starship is controlled by the FlightComputer.cs module. Which is integrated into the navLight1 part. 
The part is completely arbitrary. I just used one which I could easily add and did not use otherwise.

	MODULE
	{
		name = FlightComputer
	}

navLight1.cfg can be found here: ...\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Squad\Parts\Utility\Lights
