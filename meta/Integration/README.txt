Starship is controlled by the FlightComputer.cs module compiled into: 
\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\FlightComputer\Plugins\.

It is integrated into this part:
\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Squad\Parts\Utility\Lights\navLight1.cfg part. 

The part is arbitrary. I used one which I could add easily & didn't use otherwise.

Starship's flight path is defined in the flight_segment_configs.xml file placed here: 
\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\FlightComputer\Configs\.

Starship's .craft file must be placed here: 
\Kerbal Space Program\saves\MySave\Ships\VAB.
