Starship is controlled by the FlightComputer.cs module. It is integrated into 
the \Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Squad\Parts\Utility\Lights\navLight1.cfg part. 
The part is arbitrary. I used one which I could add easily & didn't use otherwise.

Starship's flight path is defined in the flight_segment_configs.xml file. 
It must be placed here: \Kerbal Space Program\GameData\FlightComputer\Configs\.

Starship's .craft file must be placed here: \Kerbal Space Program\saves\MySave\Ships\VAB.
