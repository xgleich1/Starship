In this step I tried to control the ascent of starship in earnest for the first time.
The goal was to have it as stable as possible, with no change in yaw, roll or pitch.

I controlled the ascent by gimbaling proportionally to the ship's attitude change.

This lead to a stable ascent. Small changes in yaw, roll or pitch were immediately corrected.
