Next up I tried to throttle individual engines of starship. 
This was done to be as close to reality as possible, where
you do not have a general throttle, naturally.

The first try resulted in a nice explosion, the throttle value was too high. 

The second try too, but this time the individual control of engine 1 is visible.
