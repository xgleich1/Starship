In this step I tried to control the ascent of starship.
The goal was to have it as stable as possible, 
with no change in yaw, roll or pitch.

After figuring out how to control the engine gimbal,
I "controlled" the ascent by gimbaling a fixed amount
each time the ship's attitude changed. 

This results in the ship becoming unstable real fast.
