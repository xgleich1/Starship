In this step I tried to bring Starship into belly flop position.
The goal was to have a stable ascent, then flip Starship onto its belly.

I controlled the ascent by gimbaling proportionally to the ship's attitude change.
The flip by gimbaling aggressively and by retracting the aft flaps (which can now be controlled).

After that the flaps are brought into the default position, as a preparation to control the descent.
